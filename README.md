*ABSTRACT*
Mooney images, two-tone visual stimuli that provide little textural, shading, and contour information to the viewer, 
offer the chance to explore edge cases in human and computer vision (Mooney, 1957). A study by Yilmaz demonstrates 
that humans are more sensitive to changes in posture by figures in Mooney images than changes in lighting despite 
changes in lighting typically causing more global change in the stimulus (2021). This work demonstrates a similar sensitivity 
in classification networks, with postural changes to a figure in a Mooney image generating a larger change in 
intermediate-layer features than changes in lighting. The results may signify that certain low-level features in 
position-changed stimuli generate the differential sensitivity and provide a strong network baseline for Yilmazâ€™s 
perceptual task.
